# RISC-Processor

In this project, I have built a structural VHDL implementation of a single-cycle reduced instruction set computer (RISC) procesor.

These are some of the instructions supported:

* Memory-reference instructions such as load word and store word.
* Arithmetic logic instructions such as addition, subtraction, and, or and set-less-than.
* Control flow instructions such as branch-equal-to and jump.
